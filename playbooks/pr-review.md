# PR review expectations

Every PR should include:
- Link to the project folder: `specs/projects/<project-name>/`
- Which milestone/task it advances
- Tests added or updated (or rationale if none)
- Any docs updates required by the artifact contract

Preferred:
- Small, focused diffs
- Clear commit messages
- Screenshots/logs for UX changes (when applicable)
