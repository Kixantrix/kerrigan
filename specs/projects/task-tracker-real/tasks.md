# Tasks: Task Tracker CLI

## Spec Phase
- [x] Create spec.md with requirements
- [x] Create acceptance-tests.md with test scenarios
- [x] PAUSE #1: Review spec scope (blocked status)
- [x] RESUME: Continue after review
- [x] Transition to architecture phase

## Architecture Phase
- [x] Create architecture.md with system design
- [x] Create plan.md with implementation phases
- [ ] Create tasks.md (this file)
- [ ] Create test-plan.md with test strategy
- [ ] Create runbook.md with deployment info
- [ ] PAUSE #2: Review architecture before implementation
- [ ] RESUME: Proceed to implementation
- [ ] Transition to implementation phase

## Implementation Phase
- [ ] Phase 1: Core data model
  - [ ] Create package structure
  - [ ] Implement Task class
  - [ ] Add Task unit tests
- [ ] Phase 2: Storage layer
  - [ ] Implement TaskStorage class
  - [ ] Add storage unit tests
- [ ] Phase 3: Business logic
  - [ ] Implement TaskManager class
  - [ ] Add TaskManager unit tests
- [ ] PAUSE #3: Review halfway through implementation
- [ ] RESUME: Complete implementation
- [ ] Phase 4: CLI layer
  - [ ] Implement CLI commands
  - [ ] Create setup.py
  - [ ] Add CLI integration tests
- [ ] Phase 5: Documentation
  - [ ] Create README with examples
  - [ ] Add help text to commands
  - [ ] Create requirements.txt
- [ ] Phase 6: Quality assurance
  - [ ] Run tests, verify coverage
  - [ ] Configure and run flake8
  - [ ] Verify LOC limits
- [ ] Transition to testing phase

## Testing Phase
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify all acceptance tests pass
- [ ] Test CLI manually
- [ ] Fix any issues found
- [ ] Transition to deployment phase

## Deployment Phase
- [ ] Create comprehensive README
- [ ] Document M3/M4 usage and lessons learned
- [ ] Create WORKFLOW-TIMELINE.md documenting actual pauses
- [ ] Update status.json to completed
- [ ] Final validation

## M3/M4 Demonstration Tracking
- [ ] Document all pause/resume cycles with timestamps
- [ ] Track agent:go label usage
- [ ] Record actual development timeline
- [ ] Capture lessons learned
- [ ] Show real status.json evolution
