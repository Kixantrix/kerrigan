# Project Status: Active Reference

**Type**: Minimal Reference Example

## Purpose

Provide a minimal example demonstrating the Kerrigan artifact structure. Serves as the simplest possible project that satisfies CI requirements.

## Scope

Intentionally minimal:
- ✅ Required artifacts (spec, acceptance tests, architecture, etc.)
- ✅ Minimal content in each artifact
- ✅ Stack-agnostic (no implementation)
- ✅ CI validation passing

## Usage

**When to reference this project**:
- Learning the minimum artifact requirements
- Understanding artifact contract structure
- Quick reference for new projects
- Validating artifact validators themselves

**Active reference**: This project remains active as ongoing reference material for the minimum viable project structure.
