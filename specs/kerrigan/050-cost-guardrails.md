# Cost guardrails (FinOps basics)

If a project uses paid resources, include:
- cost drivers (compute, storage, bandwidth, managed services)
- expected baseline cost and scaling assumptions
- budgets/alerts and who receives them
- environment separation (dev/stage/prod) if applicable
- “turn it off” procedure in runbook
