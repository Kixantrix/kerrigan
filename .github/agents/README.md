# Agent prompts

These prompts are designed to be pasted into your agent runtime (e.g., Copilot agent mode).

- `kerrigan.*.md` are Kerrigan overlay prompts (safe to customize).
- `role.*.md` define role behavior, boundaries, and required outputs.

If you use an external spec tool (e.g., Spec Kit), keep its generated prompts here too.
