# User's feedback in natural language
user_comment: |
  Describe what you'd like to change or improve.
  Be specific and explain your reasoning.
  
  Examples:
  - "The primary button feels too bright. Can we reduce saturation by 20%?"
  - "Need more padding on buttons - they feel cramped"
  - "This color doesn't meet WCAG contrast requirements"
  - "The technical-precision philosophy aligns better with our brand"
