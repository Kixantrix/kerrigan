# Example Design Feedback: Task Dashboard Button Refinement

timestamp: "2026-01-17T10:30:00Z"
project: "task-dashboard-example"
design_system: "technical-precision"
component: "button"
feedback_type: "refinement"

user_comment: |
  The primary button feels too bright for extended use. After working with 
  the dashboard for an hour, the high saturation green (#00FF41) causes 
  eye strain.
  
  Request: Reduce the saturation by about 20 percent to make it more 
  comfortable for long sessions.
  
  Also, the buttons feel cramped - could we increase the padding slightly?

current_state:
  token: "color.primary"
  value: "#00FF41"
  component_properties:
    padding: "8px 16px"
    font_size: "14px"
    border_radius: "4px"
    background: "color.primary"
  notes: |
    Current button uses bright terminal green to match technical-precision 
    philosophy. Initial design emphasized visibility and "hacker aesthetic".

requested_change:
  token: "color.primary"
  value: "#00CC34"
  component_properties:
    padding: "12px 20px"
    font_size: "14px"
    border_radius: "4px"
    background: "color.primary"
  additional:
    - "Increase button padding from 8px 16px to 12px 20px"
    - "Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratio maintained"
    - "Update hover state to maintain relative brightness"
  reason: |
    The reduced saturation maintains the technical aesthetic while being 
    easier on the eyes during extended use. The increased padding improves 
    touch target size and makes buttons feel more substantial.

  Feedback implemented in iteration 2. Changes made:
  
  **Color Token Update:**
  - Changed color.primary from #00FF41 to #00CC34
  - Verified contrast ratio: 4.8:1 (WCAG AA compliant)
  - Updated hover state: #00AA2A (maintaining 25% darker relative)
  - Updated active state: #008822 (maintaining 40% darker relative)
  
  **Button Padding Update:**
  - Changed padding from 8px 16px to 12px 20px
  - Minimum touch target now 44px height (WCAG compliant)
  
  **Impact Analysis:**
  - All button variants updated (primary, secondary, danger)
  - Badge components using color.primary also updated
  - Status indicators with primary color updated
  - Link colors remain unchanged (different token)
  
  **Testing Notes:**
  - Tested in light and dark mode
  - Verified keyboard focus visibility maintained
  - Checked color contrast on all backgrounds
  
  Please review the updated components in the playground and confirm 
  the changes meet your needs.

  Contrast Ratio Testing:
  - Primary button on white background: 4.8:1 (WCAG AA ✓)
  - Primary button on gray-50 background: 5.2:1 (WCAG AA ✓)
  - Button text (white) on primary: 12.1:1 (WCAG AAA ✓)
  - Hover state on white: 5.4:1 (WCAG AA ✓)
  
  Touch Target Size:
  - Before: 38px height (below 44px minimum)
  - After: 44px height (meets WCAG minimum ✓)

validation_results:
  contrast_ratio: "4.8:1 (WCAG AA compliant)"
  token_consistency: "All color tokens use consistent naming and structure"
  component_consistency: "All button variants updated consistently"

notes: |
  This feedback demonstrates the refinement workflow where a user tests 
  components in real usage and provides specific, actionable feedback.
  
  The design agent:
  1. Understood the specific request (color saturation, padding)
  2. Made the requested changes
  3. Analyzed impact on related components
  4. Validated accessibility requirements
  5. Provided clear explanation of all changes
  
  Next steps:
  - User reviews updated components in playground
  - If approved, status changes to "approved"
  - If more changes needed, user adds another iteration
