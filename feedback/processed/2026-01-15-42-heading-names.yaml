timestamp: "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
issue_number: 42
agent_role: "swe"
category: "prompt_clarity"
severity: "high"
title: "Validator heading names not specified in SWE prompt"

# REQUIRED: Detailed description
description: |
  The role.swe.md prompt doesn't mention that validators expect
  exact heading names (case-sensitive). I spent 20 minutes debugging
  why "Acceptance Criteria" failed validation when it should be
  "Acceptance criteria".
  
  What I expected:
  - The prompt would mention exact heading names needed
  - Or validation errors would be clearer about case sensitivity
  
  What I found:
  - Had to dig through validator code to find expected headings
  - Validation error just said "missing required section"
  - No documentation of case sensitivity requirement
  
  Impact:
  - Wasted time debugging
  - Had to rerun CI multiple times
  - Frustrating experience for first-time agent execution

# OPTIONAL FIELDS
related_files:
  - ".github/agents/role.swe.md"
  - "tools/validators/check_artifacts.py"
  - "specs/kerrigan/020-artifact-contracts.md"

related_artifacts:
  - "spec.md"
  - "acceptance-tests.md"

context: |
  This happened while working on the hello-api example project.
  The artifact validator was checking for "Acceptance criteria" but
  I had written "Acceptance Criteria" (capitalized).
  
  The error message was generic: "Missing required section in spec.md"
  without specifying which section or why it was considered missing.

proposed_solution: |
  1. Update role.swe.md to include a section listing exact heading names:
     - "Goal" not "GOAL" or "Goals"
     - "Acceptance criteria" not "Acceptance Criteria"
     - etc.
  
  2. Improve validator error messages to show:
     - Which section is missing
     - What the exact expected name is
     - Note about case sensitivity
  
  3. Add this to handoffs.md as a common gotcha.

notes: |
  Confirmed this is a real issue affecting multiple agents.
  
  Actions taken:
  1. Updated role.swe.md with explicit heading name examples
  2. Updated handoffs.md to document validator expectations
  3. Cross-checked other agent prompts - found same issue in role.architect.md
  4. Updated role.architect.md as well
  5. Created follow-up issue #45 to improve validator error messages
  
  This is a great example of high-value feedback that led to
  improvements across multiple files and prevented future friction.
