# Processed Feedback

This directory contains feedback files that have been reviewed and processed.

## Usage

Feedback files are moved here after they have been:
1. Analyzed by the daily self-improvement workflow
2. Reviewed by a human maintainer
3. Resulted in issues or documentation updates

## Retention

Processed feedback is kept for historical reference. Files older than 90 days may be archived or removed during periodic cleanup.

## Structure

Files maintain their original naming convention:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-<issue-number>-<short-slug>.yaml`
