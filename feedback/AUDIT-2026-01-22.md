### 🔄 OPEN (4 files)

Issues that remain unaddressed and need follow-up:

7. **2026-01-17-67-draft-pr-ci-triggering.yaml**
   - Status: `open`
   - Issue: Converting draft PR to ready doesn't trigger CI
   - Verified: ready_for_review trigger NOT added to workflows
   - Recommendation: Add to .github/workflows/ci.yml, agent-gates.yml, agent-spec-compliance.yml
   - Priority: Medium
   - Quick Fix: Yes - add one line to trigger types in each workflow

8. **2026-01-17-88-proactive-label-creation.yaml**
   - Status: `open`
   - Issue: Creating issues fails when labels don't exist
   - Verified: No proactive label checking script exists
   - Recommendation: Create tools/init-labels.ps1 or add checks to existing scripts
   - Priority: Low (workaround exists)
   - Quick Fix: No - requires new script creation

9. **2026-01-17-self-improvement-report-visibility.yaml**
   - Status: `open`
   - Issue: Analysis reports only in Actions artifacts, not in repository
   - Verified: Workflow doesn't commit reports or create summary issues
   - Recommendation: Create daily summary issue with metrics and artifact link
   - Priority: Medium
   - Quick Fix: No - requires workflow enhancement

10. **2026-01-17-triage-script-coverage-gaps.yaml**
    - Status: `open`
    - Issue: Missing bulk operations and interactive review scripts
    - Partially Addressed: handle-reviews.ps1 created
    - Still Missing: tools/assign-issues.ps1, tools/bulk-pr.ps1, tools/review-next.ps1
    - Priority: Medium (workarounds exist)
    - Quick Fix: No - requires multiple new scripts

### ❌ WONTFIX (1 file)

Design decision where current approach is preferred:

11. **2026-01-17-feedback-archival-mechanism.yaml**
    - Status: `wontfix`
    - Issue: Feedback files not automatically moved to processed/
    - Decision: Current date-based filtering approach is simpler and adequate
    - Rationale: No automated file movement needed; --since-days handles staleness
    - No action required

## Statistics

- **Total feedback files audited**: 11
- **Implemented**: 4 (36%)
- **Reviewed (success patterns)**: 2 (18%)
- **Open (needs action)**: 4 (36%)
- **Wontfix (by design)**: 1 (9%)

## Remaining Open Items

### High Priority
None - all high severity items have been addressed

### Medium Priority (3 items)
1. Add ready_for_review trigger to CI workflows (#67)
2. Improve self-improvement report visibility (#self-improvement)
3. Expand triage script coverage (#triage-scripts)

### Low Priority (1 item)
1. Proactive label creation tooling (#88)

## Recommendations

### Quick Wins (Can implement now)
- **Add ready_for_review trigger**: Simple one-line change to 3 workflow files

### Defer to Follow-up Issues
- Self-improvement report visibility: Requires workflow design decisions
- Triage script gaps: Multiple scripts needed, can be added incrementally
- Proactive label creation: Nice-to-have, not blocking

## Compliance with Success Criteria

1. ✅ All 11 feedback files have accurate `status` field
2. ✅ No feedback older than 7 days remains in "open" status without justification
   - All open items have clear notes explaining why they remain open
3. ⚠️ Unaddressed actionable items: 4 open, recommend creating follow-up issues
4. ✅ Feedback system is clean and reflects current reality

## Next Steps

### Option A: Implement Quick Win
1. Add ready_for_review trigger to workflows (Issue #67)
2. Close this PR after committing audit results

### Option B: Create Follow-up Issues
1. Create issues for the 3 remaining open items
2. Link them in feedback file notes
3. Close this PR after committing audit results and issue links

### Option C: Mixed Approach (Recommended)
1. Implement ready_for_review trigger fix (quick win)
2. Create follow-up issues for the other 3 open items
3. Update feedback files with issue references
4. Close this PR with all feedback properly documented
