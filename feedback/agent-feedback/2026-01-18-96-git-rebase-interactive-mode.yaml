title: "Git rebase --continue enters interactive editor mode causing agent to stall"

# REQUIRED: Detailed description
description: |
  When performing manual git rebases to resolve merge conflicts, running 
  `git rebase --continue` without setting GIT_EDITOR caused the agent to 
  enter interactive editing mode (nano/vi), which completely stalled execution.
  
  What I expected:
  - `git rebase --continue` to use default commit messages and continue
  
  What happened:
  - Terminal entered interactive editor (nano) waiting for user input
  - Agent could not send input or escape from editor mode
  - Entire rebase workflow blocked until user intervention
  
  Impact:
  - HIGH: Complete workflow stall requiring user to abort and restart
  - Manual rebases cannot complete autonomously
  - Lost progress and had to clean up .git/rebase-merge manually

# OPTIONAL FIELDS
related_files:
  - ".github/agents/role.triage.md"

context: |
  During triage of PRs #96, #98, #101 which had merge conflicts after batch 
  merging 9 other PRs. Copilot agents successfully rebased locally but couldn't 
  force-push due to sandbox limitations. Switched to manual rebase workflow.
  
  First attempt entered nano editor during `git rebase --continue` and stalled.
  User noticed the issue and pointed out I was in interactive mode.

proposed_solution: |
  ALWAYS set GIT_EDITOR environment variable before git rebase operations:
  
  ```powershell
  $env:GIT_EDITOR = 'true'; git rebase --continue
  ```
  
  The 'true' command immediately exits with success, causing git to use 
  default commit messages without entering an editor.
  
  This should be documented in:
  1. Triage agent prompt (manual rebase section)
  2. General git operation guidelines
  3. Any automation scripts that perform rebases
  
  Alternative approaches:
  - Use `git rebase --continue --no-edit` (not available in all git versions)
  - Use `GIT_EDITOR=true` prefix for all interactive git commands
  - Set globally: `git config --global core.editor "true"`

  Audited 2026-01-22: IMPLEMENTED
  
  Verified that .github/agents/role.triage.md now documents the GIT_EDITOR workaround:
  - Line 240: "# IMPORTANT: Always set GIT_EDITOR='true' to avoid entering interactive editor mode"
  - Line 242: Shows example "GIT_EDITOR='true' git rebase --continue"
  - Line 248: Includes detailed explanation of why this is needed
  
  The proposed solution has been fully implemented in the triage agent documentation.
