observation: |
  When planning a large milestone (M7 has 60+ tasks across 3 phases spanning 24 weeks),
  creating all tasks as issues upfront is counterproductive. Many tasks have unmet
  dependencies and won't be actionable for weeks.
  
  Instead, I analyzed the task breakdown and created only 7 foundational issues:
  - 4 design/architecture issues (no dependencies, block other work)
  - 2 implementation issues (depend on designs)
  - 1 tracking issue (monitors overall progress)
  
  This approach:
  - Keeps issue list focused and actionable
  - Avoids noise from blocked/future work
  - Allows designs to inform later implementation issues
  - Enables sequential issue creation as dependencies clear

pattern: |
  For multi-phase milestones:
  
  1. **Read specifications fully** (both spec.md and tasks.md)
  2. **Identify phases with clear boundaries** (M7 has 7a, 7b, 7c)
  3. **Focus on earliest phase** (7a: foundation, blocks 7b and 7c)
  4. **Within phase, identify design vs implementation:**
     - Design issues have no dependencies, block implementations
     - Implementation issues depend on designs
  5. **Create design issues first** (4 architecture/spec issues)
  6. **Create dependent implementation issues** (2 implementation issues)
  7. **Create tracking issue** (monitors phase completion)
  8. **Document dependencies in issue bodies** (until dependency syntax #84 exists)
  9. **Defer later phases** (create 7b issues after 7a completes)

recommendation: |
  **For Kerrigan (system maintainer):**
  - Document "phased issue creation" in playbooks/kickoff.md
  - Add guidance: "For milestones >20 tasks, create only first phase issues"
  - Update triage workflow to check for completed phases that need next issues
  
  **For Spec agent:**
  - When creating milestone specs, break into clear phases
  - Each phase should have ~5-10 issues maximum
  - Document phase dependencies explicitly
  - Include guidance on when to create next phase issues
  
  **For other agents:**
  - Check milestone tracking issues to understand phase boundaries
  - Don't create issues for tasks with unmet dependencies
  - When completing design work, identify blocked implementation issues

evidence: |
  Session created 7 strategic M7a issues from 60+ total tasks:
  - #82: Multi-repo spec (design, no deps)
  - #83: CLI architecture (design, no deps)
  - #84: Dependency syntax (design, no deps)
  - #85: Prompt URL system (design, no deps)
  - #86: Example multi-repo project (implementation, depends on #82)
  - #87: CLI implementation (implementation, depends on #82, #83, #84)
  - #88: M7a tracking (ongoing, monitors all)
  
  Result:
  - All 7 issues immediately actionable (no blocked work)
  - Clear dependency chain documented
  - Phase 7b deferred (depends on 7a completion)
  - Phase 7c deferred (depends on 7b completion)
  - Issue list remains focused and manageable

impact: high
actionable: true
