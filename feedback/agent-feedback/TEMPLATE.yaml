## Quick Start

1. Copy this entire file to `feedback/agent-feedback/`
2. Rename using the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-<issue-number>-<short-slug>.yaml`

4. Add optional fields as relevant
5. Leave metadata fields blank (Kerrigan will fill them)
6. Include in your PR or submit as separate feedback PR

## Category Guide

- **prompt_clarity**: Instructions are unclear or ambiguous
- **missing_information**: Prompt lacks necessary information
- **artifact_conflict**: Artifacts don't match between agents
- **tool_limitation**: Missing tools or permissions
- **quality_bar**: Unclear quality expectations
- **workflow_friction**: Process inefficiencies
- **success_pattern**: Effective techniques worth documenting

## Severity Guide

- **high**: Blocks work or causes errors
- **medium**: Causes friction but has workarounds
- **low**: Nice-to-have improvements

## Examples

See `feedback/processed/` for examples of feedback that has been reviewed and acted upon.
